Programming Assignment 2 starter code
Query spelling correction

for CS 276, Spring 2012, Stanford

buildmodels.sh and runcorrector.sh form the interface

Do not modify either buildmodels.sh or runcorrector.sh.
Please edit corrector.py and models.py.  Feel free to add your own files
if you wish.

Note: 

1. Edit the main functions of both corrector.py and models.py to implement
the interface in the .sh files. 

2. In correctory.py, the method read_query_data() is simply an example
showing how to read the query files.  You may need to modify this
function if you choose to use it.
